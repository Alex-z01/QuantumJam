# QuantumJam
<h4> This repo hosts the files to a small game we called 'Shape Attack' made for a game jam focused on Quantum Mechanics with its theme as 'patterns'. </h4>

<h2>Development Process</h2>
<p> My partner Derek and I begun this project by brainstorming a simple idea irrespecitve of quantum mechanics (since we weren't familiar with them). With 
  the intention of implementing them thematically once we had establish a foundation for the game </p>


<h2>Shape Attack</h2>
<p> 2D Arcade shooter with simple yet portable and scalable player and enemy implementations </p>
